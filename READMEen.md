**RanczoKlipy Bot** is a highly customizable Telegram bot designed to manage and process video clips from the popular TV series "Ranczo." 🎬 The bot allows users to search for specific quotes, manage their own video clips, and perform various administrative tasks related to user management and content moderation.


## 🌟 Features

### 1. 🎞️ Video Clip Management
- **🔍 Search for Quotes:** Users can search for specific quotes within the series using commands like `/clip <quote>` and `/search <quote>`. The bot will return matching video segments.
- **🎛️ Clip Compilation:** Users can compile multiple clips into a single video file with commands like `/compile <clip_numbers>` or `/compile all`.
- **⏱️ Clip Adjustment:** The bot allows for fine-tuning of clips by adjusting start and end times using `/adjust <clip_number> <adjust_before> <adjust_after>`.
- **💾 Saved Clips Management:** Users can save, list, and delete their clips with commands like `/save`, `/myclips`, and `/deleteclip`.

### 2. 🛠️ User and Role Management
- **👮‍♂️ Admin and Moderator Roles:** Admins and moderators have access to specific functionalities. Commands like `/listadmins` and `/listmoderators` help view these roles.
- **👥 Whitelist Management:** Users can be added to or removed from the whitelist, allowing them access to certain features. Use `/addwhitelist <user_id>` or `/removewhitelist <user_id>` for this.
- **📝 Notes on Users:** Admins can add notes to user profiles using the `/note <user_id> <note>` command.

### 3. 🔒 Content Moderation
- **⚠️ Report Issues:** Users can report issues directly to admins using the `/report <issue_description>` command.
- **⏳ Cooldown and Limits:** To prevent spamming, cooldown periods and limits are enforced for non-admin users, ensuring a balanced usage experience.

### 4. 📈 Elasticsearch Integration
- The bot is integrated with Elasticsearch to efficiently manage and search through transcripts of the series. This integration allows fast and accurate retrieval of video segments based on text queries.

### 5. 💽 Database Management
- The bot uses PostgreSQL for storing user data, video clips, search history, and logs. Database operations like initializing the schema and managing user data are handled through a set of robust asynchronous functions.

### 6. 🐳 Dockerized for Easy Deployment
- The bot is fully containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run on any system. The Docker setup ensures all dependencies and configurations are handled seamlessly.
