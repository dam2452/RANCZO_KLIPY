    This object contains information about the user whose identifier was shared with the bot
    using a :class:`telegram.KeyboardButtonRequestUsers` button.

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`request_id` and :attr:`user_ids` are equal.

       Bot API 7.0 replaces ``UserShared`` with this class. The only difference is that now
       the :attr:`user_ids` is a sequence instead of a single integer.

    Args:
        request_id (:obj:`int`): Identifier of the request.
        user_ids (Sequence[:obj:`int`]): Identifiers of the shared users. These numbers may have
            more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent
            defects in interpreting them. But they have at most 52 significant bits, so 64-bit
            integers or double-precision float types are safe for storing these identifiers. The
            bot may not have access to the users and could be unable to use these identifiers,
            unless the users are already known to the bot by some other means.

    Attributes:
        request_id (:obj:`int`): Identifier of the request.
        user_ids (Tuple[:obj:`int`]): Identifiers of the shared users. These numbers may have
            more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent
